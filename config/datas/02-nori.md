Nori home is a company wiching to make christmas-related accessories.

For the logo design, Nori Home requires to include a heart shape and write “home” in a smaller font.  
It should reflect charity & festivity.

As the logo should be printed everywhere, it needed a lot of variations, including a very simple design fitting to cut adhesive.
