Banjai Garden is a guesthouse located in [Chiang Mai](https://www.google.com/maps/preview?q=43+Soi+Phra+pok+klao+3,+Chiang+Mai,+thailand) (thailand).  
They needed a very simple website, which can show very quickly everything they propose. 

[Responsive design](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design) was a *must-have* as travellers access the internet on a multitude of different devices.

They also need some internationalization, mainly because of the growing chinese tourist that come in Thailand.
