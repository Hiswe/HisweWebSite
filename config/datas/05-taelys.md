Taelys is a web service providing a solution for debt & risk management. 

#### Logo

The first step was to draw a logo based on the client draft.  
The keywords for this work where: *finance, technology & proximity*.

#### Webdesign & UX Design

The focus was on **UX Design**. As finance can be very hard to understand, **the interface should adapt according to your knowledge**: you sould be able to perform basics tasks without being distract by advanced parameters, but experimented user should access those quickly.

As this UX is part of Taelys IP, I'm unable to show the designs.

#### Integration

They also need some integration help for some specific component like a [selectbox](http://dabblet.com/gist/11043337) or a [colored image](http://dabblet.com/gist/11045609)
